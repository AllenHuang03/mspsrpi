## PSRPI

This was a precursor to MSPSRPI, including 60 pulsars of which only four were MSPs. Relevant publications include:

* [Deller et al., 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...875..100D/abstract): The complete catalog paper including final results
* [Deller et al., 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...828....8D/abstract): Studies of two MSP-WD binaries


## MSPSRPI (phase 1)

Observations for MSPSRPI took place from 2015 to 2018, and focussed on 18 millisecond pulsars.
