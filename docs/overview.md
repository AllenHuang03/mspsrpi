The MSPSPI project is now in its second stage. The first stage, which encompassed observations of 18 millisecond pulsars, took observations between 2015 and 2018. The VLBA project codes were BD179 and BD192. For publications associated with phase 1 of MSPSRPI, see the [Publications]({% link publications.md %}) page.

The second phase of MSPSRPI commenced in 2024, with VLBA project code BD247. This covers 44 pulsars, all of which are observed by one or more pulsar timing arrays. The status of MSPSRPI2 observations can be seen at the [Observations]({% link MSPSRPI2/observations.md %}) page.
